# README.md

This is an [Ansible](http://ansibleworks.com/) Playbook, written to mirror the set of commands written in my [ZFSroot-on-GELI](https://www.keltia.net/howtos/mfsbsd-zfs91/) HOWTO for FreeBSD 9.

- requires Ansible 1.3.x
- requires that you have booted your remote machine with [mfsbsd](http://mfsbsd.vx.sk) with root & ssh.
- Python2.7 is installed within mfsbsd (pkg install python27 & ln -s /usr/bin )
